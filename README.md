# BowlingAlleyUnit2
- We attempted to enhance the specifications for the Bowling Management Alley
Program. 
- The software uses the MVC approach and is developed in Java.
- It is a Bowling Alley simulator in which the system replicates a control panel with numerous features such as adding new players, arranging bowling parties, allocating lanes, keeping scores, displaying pinsetter images, displaying lane status and score, and so on.
- We assessed the initially given code and its various metrics, such as C3, lines of code, and afterwards refactored the code to improve these metrics in the Unit-1 project. 
- In the Unit-2 project, we attempt to enhance the working and functionalities of our unit-1 refactored codebase and make it as per the unit-2 project needs.
